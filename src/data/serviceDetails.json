Our approach ensures business continuity while unlocking faster decision-making, operational efficiency, and a future-ready ERP foundation.",
          "whyConsider": " SAP S/4HANA is not just a system upgrade—it is a strategic business transformation. With SAP’s roadmap clearly prioritizing S/4HANA as the future of ERP, organizations running on legacy SAP ECC face rising maintenance costs, limited innovation, and increasing compliance risks. Adopting S/4HANA now enables businesses to modernize core processes, gain real-time insights, and stay competitive in a rapidly evolving digital landscape. Early adopters benefit from smoother transitions, better resource planning, and reduced long-term risk compared to last-minute migrations.",
          "intelligentEnterprise": "New user experience with Fiori apps by role on any device. The HANA database provides in-memory speed with OLAP (analytics) and OLTP (transaction processing) on one platform. Intelligent innovations: many apps include embedded analytics and artificial intelligence / machine learning. These provide actionable insights. HANA enables a simplified data model that allows many innovations e.g. accelerated period-end closing. Choice of cloud and on-premise deployment. Simplified infrastructure with less instances. Industries are part of the core solution. Modernization with new open source technologies",
          "howDifferent": "S/4HANA has taken the best ECC solutions and moved them on to a HANA database with a simplified data model. These solutions have been re-worked to take advantage of HANA and its intelligent innovations. There are new Fiori UIs, simplifications and improvements. A majority of the IMG configuration is unchanged. Over the years, SAP developed or acquired multiple solutions for the same or overlapping requirements. SAP has used this opportunity to rationalize and simplify the solution portfolio. This means that some solutions are discontinued altogether or some solutions remain but with no further investment or development. Typically, these are solutions that have been been superseded or had a low adoption in ECC. For example, credit management (FI-AR-CR) has been discontinued and you must use FSCM Credit Management. The Logistics Information System is still available but not strategic. Solutions can be co-deployed e.g., EWM (Extended Warehouse Management), TM (Transportation Management) and MDM (Master Data Management). Standard integration has been delivered between S/4HANA and cloud solutions such as Ariba. Industry solutions have become part of the standard core. Many SAP add-ons have become part of the standard core. Solutions have been modernized with newer open technologies: RESTful APIs, OData and Core Data Services (CDS). This makes adoption of disruptive technologies easier e.g. Internet of Things, Blockchain, Big Data and Machine Learning. Extension of SAP S/4HANA is possible using the SAP Cloud Platform (SCP) that allows adoption of open-source technology e.g., JavaScript, Node.js and Cloud Foundry. Keep the digital core stable and innovate outside the core."
